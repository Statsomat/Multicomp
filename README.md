<p>The app generates a report for Multiple Comparisons Procedures (MCP) with a Control, in particular the Dunnet test and variants for linear models with at least one factor (categorical predictor) of interest. Annotated output tables, graphics and a brief theoretical background are included where appropiate. This version is an experimental beta version in progress. Automated recommendations for the choice of the optimal MCP or other statistical analyzes as well the code for reproducibility will be included soon.
